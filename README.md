### **Project: Morse Code Generator in Java**  

This project aims to develop a **Morse Code Generator** using Java, which converts user-inputted text into Morse code representation. The program utilizes a **HashMap** to store Morse code mappings for alphabets (A-Z) and numbers (0-9). 
It processes user input, converts characters to their Morse code equivalents, and displays the output in a structured format. 
The project can be implemented using a **command-line interface (CLI)** or enhanced with **GUI (JavaFX/Swing)** for a better user experience. 
Additional features like **audio output for Morse signals** and **network-based encoding/decoding** can be integrated for real-world applications.  

### **Expected Outcome:**  
The outcome of this project is a functional **text-to-Morse code converter**, which can be used for educational purposes, communication in low-bandwidth environments, or emergency signaling. 
The program enhances **problem-solving skills, Java programming knowledge**, and **understanding of data structures (HashMap, StringBuilder)**. I
f extended, it could serve as a **real-time Morse communicator or decoder**. ðŸš€
